# Predicting House Occupancy in a Smart Home Environment

The multi-model agent that predicts when the house will be occupied within the next 24 hours using the energy consumption values from smart meters.
* The genetic algorithm was employed for feature engineering; the framework considers several ML algorithms (SVM, random forest, LightGBM) and picks the best for making predictions.
* The genetic algorithm is implemented as a Python package 


The notebook is formatted to be opened in Colab, where large pieces of code can be scrolled. 

To run the code properly, all necessary files should be placed into working directory.

The files required to reproduce the results can be found via the link to the Google Drive folder:

The package that performs our genetic algorithm is attached as the archive gp_features.rar.
