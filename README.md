The multi-model agent that predicts when the house will be occupied within the next 24 hours using the energy consumption values from smart meters
-The genetic algorithm was employed for feature engineering; the framework considers several ML algorithms (SVM, random forest, LightGBM) and picks the best for making predictions.
-The genetic algorithm is implemented as a Python package
